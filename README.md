# The guide to server side rendering React with Styled Components

Teaching the core concepts between React server side rendering and styled
components. This guide does not include any other libraies such as React Router
and Redux. The webpack config is as simple as we could make it -- so there's no
HMR, auto refresh, and other developer tools.

## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:Jobeir/styled-components-server-side-rendering.git
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```
